                <h1>Self-taught Vs. College degree</h1>
                <h4>By Aiden Oliver</h4>
                <p> There's a question that comes to mind everytime people talk about coding and how
                    to get started. Most people say goto to college, get a degree and companies will start
                    hiring you. Others say you don't need to goto college to get hired.
                    All you have to do is make a couple projects, contribute to open source and make a portfolio
                    website for employers to see. I think the best chance for being hired is to be passionate about 
                    your work because employers will see that. It's an interesting discussion that I think about sometimes.
                </p>  
                <p> I also knew someone who started coding in middle school and already had a job waiting for him after he got out
                    of highschool. He made a couple games, put them on the app store and companies were impressed with what he had made
                    that they started offering him jobs. I'm not sure if he went to college or just went for the job but obviously he didn't 
                    have to goto college if he didn't want to. I think the apps he made were mostly made in Objective-C or C++. He was actually
                    in one of my classes in highschool. One day he just walks into class with the thickest book I've ever seen, it had had to be
                    at least a couple thousand pages if not more and he slams it on one of the desks and says "I finally memorized this whole book".
                    I remember being completely speechless. I was like how could he learn all that and it turns out he was the one who made those
                    games on the appstore.
